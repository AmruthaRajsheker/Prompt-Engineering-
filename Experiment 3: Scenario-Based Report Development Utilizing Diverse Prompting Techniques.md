## **EXPERIMENT – 3: Scenario-Based Report Development Utilizing Diverse Prompting Techniques**

---

### **AIM**

To design and evaluate an **AI-powered conversational chatbot** capable of efficiently handling customer service interactions related to:

* **Product Troubleshooting**
* **Order Tracking**
* **General Inquiries**

The objective is to leverage and compare the efficacy of the following **prompting techniques**:

1. **Straightforward Prompting**
2. **Tabular Format Prompting**
3. **Preceding Question Prompting**

The chatbot must maintain a **natural, user-centric tone** while ensuring **response accuracy**, **relevance**, and **contextual adaptability** across customer scenarios.

---

### **ALGORITHM**

**Step 1: Define Use-Case Scenarios**

* Scenario A: A user reports a technical issue with a product (e.g., “My smart speaker isn’t responding”)
* Scenario B: A user asks for an update on a recent order (“Where is my order #12345?”)
* Scenario C: A user asks a general question about services (“What is your return policy?”)

**Step 2: Structure Prompting Strategies**

1. **Straightforward Prompting**

   * Direct instruction-based input (e.g., “Explain how to troubleshoot a smart speaker that isn’t responding.”)

2. **Tabular Format Prompting**

   * Input and expected output structured in a table for systematic clarity

   ```
   | Customer Query                             | Expected Response Format             |
   |-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
   | My speaker doesn’t connect to Wi-Fi       | Provide 3-step troubleshooting guide |
   ```

3. **Preceding Question Prompting**

   * Model is given a prior question to simulate an ongoing conversation
   * E.g.,

     * Q1: “Is your smart speaker plugged in?”
     * Q2: “Have you tried resetting it to factory settings?”

**Step 3: Build and Deploy Prompt Sets**

* Execute each scenario using all three prompting techniques
* Capture chatbot responses for each input
* Maintain consistency in platform and model (e.g., GPT-4 or Claude 3)

**Step 4: Define Evaluation Metrics**

* **Accuracy**: Relevance and correctness of information
* **Clarity**: Ease of understanding and simplicity
* **Tone**: Conversational nature and tone appropriateness
* **Context Handling**: Ability to carry contextual information (for Preceding Prompting)
* **Adaptability**: Flexibility in responding to diverse queries

**Step 5: Conduct Comparative Evaluation**

* Present responses to evaluators (team or focus group)
* Use a weighted scoring system (1–5 scale)
* Average scores across scenarios and techniques

### **RESULT**

| Prompting Technique          | Accuracy | Clarity | Tone | Context Handling | Adaptability | Avg. Score |
| ---------------------------- | -------- | ------- | ---- | ---------------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| Straightforward Prompting    | 4.5      | 4.3     | 4.1  | 3.8              | 4.2          | 4.18       |
| Tabular Format Prompting     | 4.2      | 4.7     | 4.4  | 4.0              | 4.1          | 4.28       |
| Preceding Question Prompting | 4.8      | 4.5     | 4.6  | 4.9              | 4.7          | **4.7**    |

**Key Observations:**

* **Preceding Question Prompting** outperformed other techniques in **contextual resolution and conversational flow**, ideal for multi-turn customer service scenarios.
* **Tabular Prompting** proved efficient for **structured tasks** like order tracking or FAQs, ensuring concise and formatted responses.
* **Straightforward Prompting** worked well for **one-shot tasks** but lacked depth in dynamic conversation continuity.

**Conclusion:**
For customer service chatbot development, **Preceding Question Prompting** is the most effective for delivering coherent, context-aware, and user-friendly experiences. **Tabular prompting** offers scalability for structured FAQs and **Straightforward prompts** remain reliable for isolated, direct-use cases.

This experiment validates that **prompt engineering strategy directly influences chatbot intelligence and UX delivery**, warranting continued testing across industry-specific verticals.
