* Introduce core techniques: language modeling, probabilistic sampling, latent representations

**Step 3: Examine Generative AI Architectures**

* Trace evolution from RNNs to LSTMs to Transformers
* Explain transformer mechanics: attention, embeddings, positional encoding
* Highlight architecture types: encoder-only (BERT), decoder-only (GPT), and encoder-decoder (T5)
* Discuss modern architectures: LLaMA, Gemini, Claude, Mistral

**Step 4: Analyze Applications of Generative AI**

* Classify into domains: NLP, computer vision, code generation, healthcare, etc.
* Illustrate real-world use cases: ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, DALL·E, synthetic data
