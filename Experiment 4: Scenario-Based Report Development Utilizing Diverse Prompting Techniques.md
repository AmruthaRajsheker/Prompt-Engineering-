## **EXPERIMENT – 4: Scenario-Based Report Development Utilizing Diverse Prompting Techniques**

---

### **AIM**

To demonstrate the practical application and effectiveness of **diverse prompting techniques**—namely **Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, Chain-of-Thought, Role-Based, and Multi-Modal**—in enhancing the **accuracy, empathy, and contextual intelligence** of a Smart Health Assistant chatbot, *MediGuide*. The system is tailored for elderly patients managing chronic conditions like **diabetes**, **hypertension**, and **arthritis**, and aims to provide:

* Personalized health advice
* Timely medication reminders
* Daily wellness guidance
* Emotional and motivational support

---

### **ALGORITHM**

**Step 1: Define Platform Objective**
Develop *MediGuide*, a conversational AI that simulates patient interactions and provides healthcare support with emotional empathy and clinical relevance.

**Step 2: Identify Prompting Techniques and Map to Use Cases**
Apply each prompting type to a real-world health advisory interaction, ensuring diversity in query complexity, modality, and tone.

| Prompting Technique | Scenario Type                   | Target Function                          |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Zero-Shot           | Unanticipated health queries    | Generic advisory output without context  |
| Few-Shot            | Pattern-learning from examples  | Contextual tone and content consistency  |
| Chain-of-Thought    | Complex medical decision-making | Stepwise clinical reasoning              |
| Role-Based          | Emotional wellness & elder care | Compassionate and psychologically aware  |
| Multi-Modal         | Visual input interpretation     | Data-based personalized dietary feedback |

**Step 3: Formulate Prompts**
Craft scenario-specific prompts to invoke desired AI behavior per technique.

**Step 4: Capture and Evaluate Outputs**
Generate responses using consistent AI model (e.g., GPT-4), record outputs, and evaluate based on:

* Accuracy
* Empathy
* Clarity
* Personalization
* Relevance to chronic care management

---

### **RESULT**

#### **1. Zero-Shot Prompting**

* **Use Case**: Unanticipated Query
* **Prompt**: “What should I eat for dinner if my blood sugar was high all day?”
* **Response**: Recommends low-carb options like grilled chicken and vegetables
* **Evaluation**: Direct and medically appropriate, lacks contextual nuance

**✔ Benefit**: Efficient for knowledge-based queries with no prior example

---

#### **2. Few-Shot Prompting**

* **Use Case**: Patterned Health Advice
* **Prompt**: Based on 2 Q\&A examples, a patient asks about dizziness
* **Response**: Attributes dizziness to dehydration or sugar fluctuation and advises checks
* **Evaluation**: Improved response tone and patient-centric empathy

**✔ Benefit**: Learns conversational flow and caregiving tone through examples

---

#### **3. Chain-of-Thought Prompting**

* **Use Case**: Post-meal insulin guidance
* **Prompt**: “Help the user decide if they should take insulin after a sugar spike.”
* **Response**: Stepwise reasoning—check sugar, follow plan, avoid assumptions
* **Evaluation**: High clarity and decision-making safety

**✔ Benefit**: Enables risk-averse, medically reasoned suggestions

---

#### **4. Role-Based Prompting**

* **Use Case**: Emotional Support
* **Prompt**: “You are a compassionate caregiver. The patient says: ‘I feel lonely and tired all the time.’”
* **Response**: Validates emotion, offers comfort and gentle options
* **Evaluation**: Exceptional emotional intelligence and tone modulation

**✔ Benefit**: Ideal for mental health and geriatric care empathy

---

#### **5. Multi-Modal Prompting**

* **Use Case**: Visual Diet Analysis
* **Prompt**: Image of salmon, broccoli, brown rice; “Is this a good meal for high BP?”
* **Response**: Analyzes sodium, nutrient content, and portioning
* **Evaluation**: Integrates image content with dietary relevance

**✔ Benefit**: Cross-modal health coaching using image-to-text alignment

---

### **CONCLUSION**

The integration of diverse prompting strategies in *MediGuide* significantly enhances the **functionality, user trust, and health impact** of AI-driven medical support tools. Key takeaways:

| Prompting Strategy | Key Strength                                      |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Zero-Shot          | Quick generalization for FAQs and routine tips    |
| Few-Shot           | Improved tone, trust, and human-like engagement   |
| Chain-of-Thought   | Logical sequencing for medically sensitive issues |
| Role-Based         | Empathy-driven response generation                |
| Multi-Modal        | Personalized advice from image-based inputs       |

In future iterations, combining these prompting techniques dynamically (hybrid prompting) could further enhance *MediGuide*'s effectiveness in **personalized, emotionally intelligent, and evidence-based elder care systems**.
